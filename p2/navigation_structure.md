# Navigation structure
The site will be structured to facilitate easy navigation between different
artistic reviews of the Trondheim coffee scene. There will be a home page acting
as a sort of landing page where all cafées are listed as well as links to the
about and contact section. The about section introduces the authors and their
knowledge in the field both using textual and graphical elements to capture
their driven and creative approach towards perhaps the most appealing past time
of this century. The landing page will list the cafées using images and a short
description. On each cafe page, reviews are presented in a custom style
representing our artistic interpretation of the café. It will also contain text
sections structured in headlines and paragraphs, giving a thorough review. A
selection of photos from the café will be displayed to elevate the text nicely.
