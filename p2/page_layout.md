During a fruitful discussion among us hip yound coffe drinkers, we embraced the
following desing, valuing clarity and a distinct look of each cafe above all
else. Considering that the Trondheim elite seeks a lifechanging cup of coffee,
this is the right move. Each cafe stands out for itself, but the pages are in
fact tightly connected to eachother. This allows for an embrace of the current
cafe, while at the same time provides the user with a minimum amount of clicks
to find a new one. We focused on making the design reflect each indivudial cafe,
respecting each bistro as the unique and beautiful place it is. The result is a
genuine echo of impressions they gave us.
The design reflects the hip young elite of Trondheim.
