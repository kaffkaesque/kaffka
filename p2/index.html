            <h2> Purpose, goals and audience </h2>
            <p>
            The site's purpose is to be a leading star for hip young coffee drinkers. The site will contain useful and artistic reviews of a selection of 
            cafés in Trondheim city. What stronger purpose can there be than to discover something profound through a coffee drinking experience.
            </p>
            <p>
            Using our power as influencers, we will guide young adults towards the right way of expressing their identity and uniqueness. The journey starts 
            with a far-reaching coffee drinking experience.
            </p>
            <p>
            Our service is for those who experience the Kafkaesque feeling of navigating the jungle of coffee recommendations from the online plebeians. 
            These coffee lovers are the hip, urban, students looking for the best possible cup of coffee in downtown Trondheim. These elegant elites' taste 
            is superior; only experts with the same sense of profound taste are able to address their despair – i.e. us.
            </p>

            <h2> Navigation Structure </h2>
            <p>
            The site will be structured to facilitate easy navigation between different artistic reviews of the Trondheim coffee scene. 
            There will be a home page acting as a sort of landing page where all cafées are listed as well as links to the about and contact section. 
            The about section introduces the authors and their knowledge in the field both using textual and graphical elements to capture their 
            driven and creative approach towards perhaps the most appealing past time of this century. The landing page will list the cafées using 
            images and a short description. On each cafe page, reviews are presented in a custom style representing our artistic interpretation of the 
            café. It will also contain text sections structured in headlines and paragraphs, giving a thorough review. A selection of photos from the 
            café will be displayed to elevate the text nicely.

            <h2> Page Layout and Appearance </h2>
            <p>
            During a fruitful discussion among us hip yound coffe drinkers, we embraced the following desing, valuing clarity and a distinct look of 
            each cafe above all else. Considering that the Trondheim elite seeks a lifechanging cup of coffee, this is the right move. Each cafe stands out 
            for itself, but the pages are in fact tightly connected to eachother. This allows for an embrace of the current cafe, while at the same time 
            provides the user with a minimum amount of clicks to find a new one. We focused on making the design reflect each indivudial cafe, respecting each 
            bistro as the unique and beautiful place it is. The result is a genuine echo of impressions they gave us. The design reflects the hip young 
            elite of Trondheim.
