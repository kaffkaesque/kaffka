# Purpose, Goal and Audience

## Purpose
The site's purpose is to be a leading star for hip young coffee drinkers. The
site will contain useful and artistic reviews of a selection of cafés in
Trondheim city. What stronger purpose can there be than to discover something
profound through a coffee drinking experience.

## Goal
Using our power as influencers, we will guide young adults towards the right way
of expressing their identity and uniqueness. The journey starts with a
far-reaching coffee drinking experience.

## Audience
Our service is for those who experience the Kafkaesque feeling of navigating the
jungle of coffee recommendations from the online plebeians. These coffee lovers
are the hip, urban, students looking for the best possible cup of coffee in
downtown Trondheim. These elegant elites' taste is superior; only experts with
the same sense of profound taste are able to address their despair – i.e. us.
