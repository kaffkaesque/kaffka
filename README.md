## Purpose
The site's purpose is to be a leading star for hip young coffee drinkers. The site will contain useful and artistic reviews of a selection of cafés in Trondheim city. Using our power as influencers, we will guide young adults towards the right way of expressing their identity and uniqueness. What stronger purpose can there be than to discover something profound through a coffee drinking experience.

## Target audience
Our service is for those who experience the Kafkaesque feeling of navigating the jungle of coffee recommendations from the online plebeians. These coffee lovers are the hip, urban, students looking for the best possible cup of coffee in downtown Trondheim.  These elegant elites' taste is superior;  only experts with the same sense of profound taste are able to address their despair – i.e. us.
