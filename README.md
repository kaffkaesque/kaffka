This site is a group as assignment in IT2805 Webteknologi where the client is the honarble hip elite of Trondheim, looking for a life-changing cup of coffee in downtown Trondheim.

## Purpose
The site's purpose is to be a leading star for hip young coffee drinkers. The site will contain useful and artistic reviews of a selection of cafés in Trondheim city. Using our power as influencers, we will guide young adults towards the right way of expressing their identity and uniqueness. What stronger purpose can there be than to discover something profound through a coffee drinking experience.

## Target audience
Our service is for those who experience the Kafkaesque feeling of navigating the jungle of coffee recommendations from the online plebeians. These coffee lovers are the hip, urban, students looking for the best possible cup of coffee in downtown Trondheim.  These elegant elites' taste is superior;  only experts with the same sense of profound taste are able to address their despair – i.e. us.

## Structure
The site will be structured to facilitate easy navigation between different artistic reviews of the Trondheim coffee scene. There will be a home page acting as a sort of landing page where all café reviews are listed as well as links to the about and contact section. The about section introduces the authors and their knowledge in the field both using textual and graphical elements to capture their driven and creative approach towards perhaps the most appealing past time of this century. The landing page will list the reviews using images and a short description. Each review will be in a custom style representing our artistic interpretation of the café being reviewed. It will also contain text sections structured in headlines and paragraphs, giving a thorough review. A selection of photos from the café will be displayed to elevate the text nicely.
