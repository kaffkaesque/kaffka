                        <h1>Teluriana, the tell tale traveller</h1>
                        <p>
                            Telluriana majored in eastern cultures at the state university of Ohio. Combining her sharp wit, with an excellent understanding of beauty, she discovers the unpolished pearls in the most unexpected places.

                        <p>
                            Read her reviews cautiously as you traverse the kaffkaesque jungle of coffee, as she might be just a little more adventurous than our other reviewers.

                            Should you however find yourself knocking at an anonymous door in a compartment complex late at night. Know that she would never lead you there without purpose.

                            <p>
                                Win Pyi Hein was born in Singapore, and given the english name Thunder by his parents. In our loosely coupled writers crew he is the voice of justice. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the big city of Singapore he acquired an exclusive taste for coffee. Now he travels the world, still searching for the perfectly brewed blend of coffee. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                His scientific approach, is combined with a strong sense of justice. All ingredients should be tracked to their origin. No one should have suffered for the cup he drinks.
