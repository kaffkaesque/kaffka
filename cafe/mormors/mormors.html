                            Located in a back alley, Mormors Stue might be the hardest-to-find cafe reviewed by us.  However, this is a known waterhole for the students – especially those affiliated with the humanities.

                        <p>
                            As the name suggests, the cosiness of the cafe is sublime.  However, when it comes to the coffee itself, it is subprime.  When visiting, I ordered an Americano.  I was politely asked if I wanted the Americano with "milk or water".  No more is needed to be said.
